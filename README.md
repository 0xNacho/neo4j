Neo4j - The World's Leading Graph Database
==========================================

*Neo4j is a high-performance, NOSQL graph database with all the features of a mature and robust database.* The programmer works with an object-oriented, flexible network structure rather than with strict and static tables â€” yet enjoys all the benefits of a fully transactional, enterprise-strength database. For many applications, Neo4j offers performance improvements on the order of 1000x or more compared to relational DBs.

Neo4j is an open source (you're reading it) project available in a GPLv3 Community edition, with Advanced and Enterprise editions available under both the AGPLv3 and commercial licenses, supported by [Neo Technology](http://neotechnology.com/).

*Please note* that this GitHub repository contains mixed GPL and AGPL code.  Our community edition (in the community/ directory) is GPL. Our advanced and enterprise editions (advanced/ and enterprise/, you get the drill) are Affero GPL and so have different licensing implications.

Building Neo4j
--------------

This build will build all of our product, including documentation. If you don't have the tools for documentation (e.g. asciidoc, LaTeX), then use pass the -DskipNativeDeps flag to Maven.


We also supply commercial licenses. Please contact [Neo Technology](sales@neotechnology.com) for more information.
